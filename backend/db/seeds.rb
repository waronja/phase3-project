Meal.create(strMeal: "Corba", strInstructions: "Pick through your lentils for any foreign debris, rinse them 2 or 3 times, drain, and set aside.  Fair warning, this will probably turn your lentils into a solid block that youâ€™ll have to break up later\r\nIn a large pot over medium-high heat, sautÃ© the olive oil and the onion with a pinch of salt for about 3 minutes, then add the carrots and cook for another 3 minutes.\r\nAdd the tomato paste and stir it around for around 1 minute. Now add the cumin, paprika, mint, thyme, black pepper, and red pepper as quickly as you can and stir for 10 seconds to bloom the spices. Congratulate yourself on how amazing your house now smells.\r\nImmediately add the lentils, water, broth, and salt. Bring the soup to a (gentle) boil.\r\nAfter it has come to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot halfway, and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the lentils have fallen apart and the carrots are completely cooked.\r\nAfter the soup has cooked and the lentils are tender, blend the soup either in a blender or simply use a hand blender to reach the consistency you desire. Taste for seasoning and add more salt if necessary.\r\nServe with crushed-up crackers, torn up bread, or something else to add some extra thickness.  You could also use a traditional thickener (like cornstarch or flour), but I prefer to add crackers for some texture and saltiness.  Makes great leftovers, stays good in the fridge for about a week.", strMealThumb:"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/58oia61564916529.jpg")

Cover with a thin layer of filling and cover this with another layer of filo pastry which must be well coated in oil. Put another layer of filling and cover with pastry. When you have five or six layers, cover with filo pastry, bake at 200ÂºC/392ÂºF for half an hour and cut in quarters and serve.", strMealThumb:"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/tkxquw1628771028.jpg")
Meal.create(strMeal: "Kumpir", strInstructions:"If you order kumpir in Turkey, the standard filling is first, lots of butter mashed into the potato, followed by cheese. Thereâ€™s then a row of other toppings that you can just point at to your heartâ€™s content â€“ sweetcorn, olives, salami, coleslaw, Russian salad, allsorts â€“ and you walk away with an over-stuffed potato because you got ever-excited by the choices on offer.\r\n\r\nGrate (roughly â€“ you can use as much as you like) 150g of cheese.\r\nFinely chop one onion and one sweet red pepper.\r\nPut these ingredients into a large bowl with a good sprinkling of salt and pepper, chilli flakes (optional)", strMealThumb: "https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/mlchx21564916997.jpg" )

Pat the beans dry with a towel.\r\nGrind the beans in a food mill or meat grinder.If neither appliance is available, process them in a food processor but only until the beans form a paste.

Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\r\nShape the bean mixture into 1-inch balls.Flatten slightly and coat with flour.\r\nHeat at least 1Â½-inches of oil over medium heat to 365 degrees.\r\nFry the patties in batches, turning once, until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes.Remove with a wire mesh skimmer or slotted spoon.
